**Problem statement:** The abundance of information on the internet, especially through social media, has led to a surge of fake news. This spread of false information threatens public perception, decision-making, and democratic societies. Manually verifying the vast amount of online content is impractical and time-consuming. Thus, an automated system to distinguish between real and fake news is essential to provide users with accurate information

**Goal:** The project aims to contribute to media literacy by providing users with a tool that facilitates critical analysis of news articles. By promoting awareness and informed decision-making, the system will empower individuals to navigate the digital information landscape with confidence, fostering a more vigilant and discerning society
